# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

This repository explores the use of a Random Forest Classifier for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

The dataset used here is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

### Key Features:

 * Model: Utilizes the powerful Random Forest algorithm for accurate fraud prediction.
 * Data: Employs a dataset containing historical credit card transactions, including features like transaction amount, time, and potentially other relevant information.
 * Objective: To build a robust model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives and false negatives.

### Key Steps:

 * Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling class imbalance (as fraud cases are often rare).
 * Model Training: Training a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.
 * Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Benefits of using Random Forest:

 * High accuracy: Known for its high accuracy in classification tasks.
 * Handles high dimensionality well: Can effectively handle datasets with numerous features.
 * Provides feature importance: Allows for understanding which features are most important for fraud detection.
